This program is used to validate that all expected audit events are being
sent. To use this program, first as root extract a test case:

# su - root -c ./gather-test-case

then

# make
# ./audit-validate -f audit.log

The program is validating that:
1) SYSTEM_START, SYSTEM_SHUTDOWN events are occuring
2) For every started service you get a matching service_stop event
3) Eventually it will check the user session
